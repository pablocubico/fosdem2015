						I'm a Mozilla Rep in my country, despite having some differences with some latest year's decisions.
						Also, I'm the founder of the local chapter of Hacks/Hackers in my hometown. For those of you who don't know what Hacks/Hackers is, it's a crossover between journalists and developers for data journalism and related topics. As a first project, we mapped the drug related murders on my city for 2013.

						<h2>What is Open Source UX?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							So, we are here to talk about Open Source UX, or UX for free and open source projects.
							Sadly, this is something that doesn't quite exists yet, so let's use this time to talk about UX design processes and about opening them. 
							But even before asking what is open source UX, we should ask this instead: 
						</aside>

						<h2>What is UX anyway?</h2>
						<img src="img/sasquatch.jpg" style="max-width: 45%">
						<aside class="notes">
							As the sasquatch (or bigfoot), an actual definition of UX is a really hard thing to find. 
							There is a lot of noise around what UX actually is.
							Let me introduce you to what I think UX is so we can all be in the same page for that matter.
						</aside>

					<section>
						<h2>UX stands for <span class="fragment highlight-blue">USER</span>&nbsp;<span class="fragment highlight-blue">EXPERIENCE</span></h2>
						<img style="max-width: 40%" src="img/cagememe.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Ok, I'm stating the obvious here. But let's use this as an exercise to clear our heads and reboot what we think of user experience.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>User Experience is...</h2>
						<h3>the experience a user has while using a product.</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">It can be measured</li>
							<li class="fragment">It can be improved</li>
							<li class="fragment">It can be <em>developed</em> and <em>designed</em></li>
						</ul>
						
						<aside class="notes">
							The experience of a user can be measured through many tools, mostly, by the user's feedback.

						<h2>GOOD User Experience</h2>

						<aside class="notes">
							Most authors try to avoid defining some universal rules, and I hate that. So I brought some of my own to share with you.
							I like to think of user experience (and design in all its flavors), as the way in which we communicate with technology.

						<h2>Common misconceptions and myths</h2>
						<img src="img/gestalt.jpg" style="max-width: 45%">
						<aside class="notes">
							People have different views about what UX is or should be. Let's start by debunking some common misconceptions and myths around UX.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>"UX is a process"</h2>
						<h3>No, UX is an <em>attribute</em> of your product.</h3>
						<h3 class="fragment">UX <em>design</em> is a process.</h3>
						<img src="img/okmeme.jpg" style="max-width: 70%">
						<aside class="notes">
							Say what? UX is not a process?.
							You will find tons of sites saying how and why "UX" itself is a process. Well, if you say "UX", you are not talking about a process, you are talking about an attribute of your product (or someone else's).
							Remember, UX is an attribute, UX DESIGN is a process, or if you prefer, UX DEVELOPMENT.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>UX is not beauty</h2>
						<img src="img/vitruvio.jpg" style="max-width: 45%">
						<aside class="notes">
							Of course beauty plays an important role in something that we call "experience", but beauty is an elusive concept, you can try to measure it and going golden ratio all over your buttons and headings, but that won't magically translate into good user experience.
							However, beautiful design conveys many values, as TRUST. Users will often trust a beautiful design over a flawed one. 
							We will come back to this later.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>UX is UI</h2>
						<h3>UX involves many other things</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Visual design</li>
							<li class="fragment">Interaction design</li>
							<li class="fragment">User testing</li>
							<li class="fragment">Performance</li>
							<li class="fragment">etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							UX is more than just UI design. UX is about developing your user's experience, and that alone requires involvement from a lot of different areas.

						<h3>UX vs. UI: a few samples</h3>
						<img style="max-width: 40%" src="img/not-ui.jpg" alt="">
						<p>Don't worry, I'll read aloud.</p>

					<section>
						<h2>"Drop an asset library<br>and BAM!: UX"</h2>
						<img style="max-width: 40%" src="img/ui-kit-1.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							UX design is a process, it has to be deeply embedded into the development process,
							as it is iterative.<br>
							Open UI libs may solve a problem or two, but UX is different in every product,
							so it will always be developed for that product only.

						<h2>The infamous<br>"Design is art" myth</h2>
						<blockquote class="prettyBig prettyPadded" cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
						"<strong>open source design</strong> is an oxymoron."<br>
						-Chris Messina
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							Whoa! Another title.
							This is a very unfortunate and misleading quote.
							Some say design is art so it can't be done by collaborating, but design
							is not merely art. Art is totally unpaired with function, maybe we can
							discuss what's the "function" of art, but that's another topic.
							Let's see an industrial design example.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Design is form + function</h3>
						<img src="img/iron.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Style is unique to every designer, but design problems
							are constrained by the needs of function.
							Design comes from architecture (mostly), so does industrial design.
							Take this Siemens iron for example, it serves a purpose, so
							it basically looks like any iron, the color choice and ornamental
							details may vary from one to another, but the general function
							is dominant.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Flawed design</h3>
						<img src="img/bad-design.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							When design fails to serve its purpose, this happens.
							So this is not design, instead, it's a pretty strong art piece.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Style varies</h3>
						<h4>It's a <span class="fragment highlight-blue">visual design</span> problem, not a UX one</h4>
						<img src="img/design-styles.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Style varies from one designer to another. This can lead to
							consistency issues, but it can be definitely solved by 
							agreeing on style conventions which are deeply intertwined with
							identity choices.

						<h2>"Free Software UX sucks"</h2>
						<h3 class="fragment">"Commercial software does better"</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							I hate this quotes. This is yet another misconception, and a generalisation that really hurts our community.
							Also, big corporations spend a lot of money to convince you that their UX is good. Let me show you an example from real life.

						<h2>Problems in FOSS UX</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>1. Lack of participation</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							There is an obvious lack of involvement of designers into 
							free software projects.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>2. No clear paths <br>for contribution</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Often, when you go to a project wiki, docs, issue trackers, community
							forums or whatever, it is hard to find which UX problems are there
							and how to solve them. 
							You'll find more "UI errors" than "UX problems". 
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>3. Devs don't know where to start</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							People who is actually coding the UI don't know about the UX design process
							and they don't know where to start.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>4. Disconnected lone rangers</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							UI coders who don't work together produce both inconsistent code and UIs.
							Not having "UI teams" working towards consistency creates random pieces
							of UI goodness distributed in isolated pieces through a product.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>5. Style differences</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							When you actually have designers contributing, there will be style differences
							between them. As an artist, each designer has a unique style. These need to be sorted
							through a higher convention.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>6. "Can I Haz" requests</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Many times designers come with ideas that are unrealistic
							and difficult to implement, like whole new features. 
							These won't help as much as doing little improvements.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>7. Everyone is a designer</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Open source is about collaboration, but sometimes this leads
							to hundreds of people trying to be involved in design choices.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>8. Customize all the things</h2>
						<img src="img/customize-everything.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Free software makers often try to make software as customizable as possible.
							This is deeply linked to the heart and nature of open source, but it's really
							difficult to do well, and it leads to a lack of identity on many products.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>9. No proper tools</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Most tools of the trade for UX designers are closed and paid.
							We definitely need to find the right tools for design collaboration, 
							design voting, UX prototyping, etc.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>10. No T-shaped devs/designers</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							It's hard to find those with the skills to do both design and development. It is really useful to have one of those T-shaped people to integrate both worlds into one.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>11. Code health</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							UI code can be a real mess. It's hard to do improvements on an unhealthy codebase, changing things as the underlying layout sometimes is just plainly impossible. You'll need to find a compromise between code quality, refactoring and improvement pace to even start minor things.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>12. No room for you</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Is design welcomed? If it's not in the mind of the current contributors, getting them to work with you on a timely basis will be impossible. 
							Closed groups leave room for no one, sometimes it is difficult enough just trying to contribute, even more when you are a designer, an alien into the development world. That's why those T-shaped professionals are needed.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>13. No visibility</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Another situation may occur: you contribute, you send a pull request, a patch... and then no one sees it.
							It happened to me, I have some trouble getting people involved in things as Diaspora's identity. 
							Many developers are not interested in design talk, many consider it irrelevant. This could also affect you emotionally, if you invest a couple of hours in a project, with confidence, and your worked gets drowned in a sea of nothingness, you'll get angry. Staying cool requires a lot of patience.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>14. Style dilution</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is mostly for pure designers. Style will always have a strong influence from a core designer. Why? Because that's the artistic part of design, it's really hard to develop a style for a product by trying to please everyone. 
							This is one of the hardest points, because this is the place where collaboration becomes an obstacle.
							For that reason, you have to struggle to justify your stylistic and aesthetic choices with reasoning, good will, and be ready to discuss a lot.
							But as you know, a picture is worth a thousand words, so maybe if you show your work and the community engages with your style, maybe making a few compromises, then you can earn the trust you need to continue working.
							Community has to trust and value a designer's vision, your style, and your aesthetics. 
							By having a single person's vision and trust, UI coders and interested people can work faster under that aesthetic umbrella.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>15. Assumptions, assumptions everywhere.</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Sad but true, when a project is ongoing for a few years and the UX remains pretty much untouched, be pretty sure that everyone is making assumptions about what users do or want with almost no data. 
							Common sense can be your friend or your enemy in this area.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>16. Resisting change</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							We all heard this one, as it often happens in our daily lives. Change is hard, not everyone welcomes it and you'll find a lot of "oh, it has been this way for two years, why change it". 
							However, you have to listen to that resistance, maybe you are trying to change something that actually... shouldnt be changed...
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>17, 18, 19... many others...</h2>
						<h3>Have you tried? Share your experience!</h3>
						<aside class="notes">
							So there are a lot of other issues when it comes to integrate UX design into the FOSS development processes. Share your findings now or after the slides.

						<h2>A roadmap for Contributing UX</h2>
						<h4>Challenges and opportunities</h4>
						<img class="noStyle" src="img/git-design-polish.jpg">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>0: Introduce yourself</h2>
						<h3>Become a member</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Invite yourself to the party</li>
							<li>Identify some measurable problems</li>
							<li>Do some work to show your potential</li>
							<li>Be bold, there is always time to go back</li>
							<li>Be humble</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							The first need you'll to step into a FOSS project as a UX designer is introducing yourself. If you are being honest about your goals, it will come easy. Set your goals, find your motivations, don't try to be a hero.
							But be bold, invite yourself to it. No one is going to ask you to improve the UX of a particular project, if you believe you can, just jump aboard and make a suggestion. Some will welcome you, some not, some will just ignore you, but then you'll know if there is room for contributing or not.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>1. Get to know the community!</h2>
						<h4>Biggest perk from FOSS projects</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Always ask the community</li>
							<li>Get validation</li>
							<li>Be honest</li>
							<li>Invite others to join your quest</li>
							<li>Give recognition</li>
							<li>Don't take over</li>
							<li>Relax your ego</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="img/communities.jpg" height="300" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Community is the biggest perk we have from FOSS projects.
							This is what most commercial projects don't have. 
							It has it's pros and cons, but overall, we can leverage the community
							to build the basics of User Experience for a product, and to do many other
							tasks, specially, the most important one: user testing.
							First, you'll have to get validation from the community. Contributing a patch could be a great start, but also, showing your good will and your expertise could help.
							Remember, you'll not go anywhere unless you are a member of the community, so you'll need to have the social skills to do so.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>2. Consider starting with identity</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Analyze current status (colors, fonts, etc)</li>
							<li>Gather community opinions (survey)</li>
							<li>Begin with a proposal</li>
							<li>Explain why brand matters</li>
							<li>Beware of sensitive stuff (i.e.: LOGO)</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="img/identity.jpg" height="300" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							What's the status of identity on an X project?
							Identity will give you the basis for color choices, fonts, and it's also the first part of User Experience.
							By gathering the current status of identity and asking the community to define a better brand for the product.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>3. Identify current UX problems</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Ask people, they know</li>
							<li>How about some user testing?</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Some UX problems may already be known in the community.
							Always ask the community first before asserting an assumption.
							Remember, assumptions are not good for UX. Data is.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>4. Get UX into the integration loop</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Make UX a phase of development</li>
							<li>Get developers in the loop</li>
							<li>Test everything</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							UX should be deeply integrated into the software
							development process, as in a continuous integration scheme.
							Do user testing for UI changes.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>5. Prototype and discuss</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A/B testing (if possible)</li>
							<li>Test prototypes</li>
							<li>Give UI coders a finished prototype</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Once you get the prototype right, the widgets in place
							and the interactions in a well written spec, the task
							for developers is really easy. 
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>6. Baby steps, small changes</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't go for the full redesign</li>
							<li>Propose small fixes</li>
							<li>Minimize coding effort</li>
							<li>Identify as many small problems as possible</li>
							<li>If possible, code something and show it</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							What can be fixed through only CSS?
							What can be done with just a line of code?
							There are many UX situations that can be drastically
							improved by just a few fixes. If you have the skills, you can even show how a minor change would impact the UX in a browser window.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>7. Find a team</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>There is people working on UI</li>
							<li>Ask for participation</li>
							<li>Identify potential "UX people"</li>
							<li>Get coders, translators, users, testers</li>
							<li>Create conventions and standards for consistency</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Doing UX solo is not an easy task. You'll need tons
							of help from others.
							There is always people fond of UX and UI amongst coders. 
							Some coders hate talking about UIs, but some actually love it.
							You can also recruit other kinds of people with different skills, to conduct a user testing session, to make prototypes, to translate things, etc.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>8. Set goals and deadlines</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Deadlines are the ultimate fast decision makers</li>
							<li>Use UX metrics to set goals</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							No roadmap is a roadmap without goals and deadlines.
							Define sprints and use deadlines and milestones to 
							give others feedback of what your progress is.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>9. Show the larger picture</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Build a longer roadmap</li>
							<li>Get approval from the community</li>
							<li>Be realistic</li>
							<li>Review constantly</li>
							<li>If needed, reformulate</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							A mid-term roadmap will build trust around your work and

						<h4>Non-constructive criticism</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>"It feels weird..."</li>

						<h2>11. Adapt to the flow</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Version control</li>
							<li>Issue trackers</li>
							<li>Languages (ruby, python, etc)</li>
							<li>Frameworks</li>
							<li>Contribution platforms</li>
							<li>Mailing lists</li>
							<li>IRC Chatrooms</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Don't get into the group proposing new tools if you want things to go smoothly. On the contrary, learn where the contributors hang out, learn the current tools, platforms and frameworks used. Dive into the flow and get yourself soaked with it, until you become another member of the group. You'll know when you are.
							Don't be a solo warrior that comes up with magic solutions once a week.
							Contributing is not always making deliverables, or writing code. Discussing can be also contributing, teaching is contributing, helping others is contributing.

					<section>
						<h2>12. Use open formats</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate designers on open tools (Inkscape, GIMP, etc)</li>
							<li>Make assets freely available</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							As a free software advocate, I really encourage everyone to use	open formats. I've been a closed format slave for way too long, 
							and if we are talking about UX for free software, then why don't we do it for real and start using these formats.

							***(open old and new diaspora site on tabs)***
							I wanted to start making a bold move: a whole redesign of the Diaspora Foundation site.
							This goes against some of the UX methods I talked about in this talk, but it was good to set a starting point and get the discussion rolling.

						<h2>Going back a step</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Realized there was an identity problem</li>
							<li>Get to work on identity first</li>
							<li>Find out some identity inconsistencies:
								<p>Helvetica vs. Roboto, etc</p>
							</li>
							<li>Started an <a href="https://github.com/pablocubico/diaspora-identity">identity project on github</a>, made with Inkscape</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							With the Diaspora foundation redesign, I found there were some
							differences about identity in the community. So I decided I needed to
							help diasporians out and tackle identity first.
							Identity would give us the first choices on font, colors, and consistency.

						<h2>Next steps (2015)</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Get the UI team engaged</li>

						<h2>Main drawback: TIME</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't have money, have to work</li>
							<li>My speed for contributing sucks</li>
							<li>Don't have a detailed roadmap yet for crowdfunding</li>
							<li>Also, crowdfunding can't be just for me</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							My contribution pace plainly sucks, I hope I could do better next year.
							I thought about crowd funding but I think it would be unfair to ask for money for myself.
							Right now, I think that we could do a crowd funding campaign once we set a good roadmap,
							some prototypes, and a UI team, then we can do a campaign to sustain the UI team as a whole.

							Doing UX for open source projects is pretty much about understanding how free software is built, how the communities work, and that is what coders know and designers don't.

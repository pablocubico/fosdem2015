						<h2>What is Open Source UX?</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							So, we are here to talk about Open Source UX, or UX for free and open source projects.
							Sadly, this is something that doesn't quite exists yet, so let's use this time to talk about UX design processes and about opening them. 
							But even before asking what is open source UX, we should ask this instead:

						<h2>What is UX anyway?</h2>
						<img src="img/sasquatch.jpg" style="max-width: 45%">
						<aside class="notes">
							As the sasquatch (or bigfoot), an actual definition of UX is a really hard thing to find. 
							There is a lot of noise around what UX actually is.
							Let me introduce you to what I think UX is so we can all be in the same page for that matter.

						<h2>UX stands for <span class="fragment highlight-blue">USER</span>&nbsp;<span class="fragment highlight-blue">EXPERIENCE</span></h2>
						<img style="max-width: 40%" src="img/cagememe.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Ok, I'm stating the obvious here. But let's use this as an exercise to clear our heads and reboot what we think of user experience.
						</aside>

						<h2>User Experience is...</h2>

							<li class="fragment">It can be measured</li>
							<li class="fragment">It can be improved</li>
							<li class="fragment">It can be <em>developed</em> and <em>designed</em></li>

						<aside class="notes">
							The experience of a user can be measured through many tools, mostly, by the user's feedback.

						<aside class="notes">
							Most authors try to avoid defining some universal rules, and I hate that. So I brought some of my own to share with you.
							I like to think of user experience (and design in all its flavors), as the way in which we communicate with technology.

						<h2>Common misconceptions and myths</h2>
						<img src="img/gestalt.jpg">
						<aside class="notes">
							People have different views about what UX is or should be. Let's start by debunking some common misconceptions and myths around UX.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>"UX is a process"</h2>
						<h3>No, UX is an <em>attribute</em> of your product.</h3>
						<h3 class="fragment">UX <em>design</em> is a process.</h3>
						<img src="img/okmeme.jpg" style="max-width: 70%">
						<aside class="notes">
							Say what? UX is not a process?.
							You will find tons of sites saying how and why "UX" itself is a process. Well, if you say "UX", you are not talking about a process, you are talking about an attribute of your product (or someone else's).
							Remember, UX is an attribute, UX DESIGN is a process, or if you prefer, UX DEVELOPMENT.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>UX is not beauty</h2>
						<img src="img/vitruvio.jpg" style="max-width: 45%">
						<aside class="notes">
							Of course beauty plays an important role in something that we call "experience", but beauty is an elusive concept, you can try to measure it and going golden ratio all over your buttons and headings, but that won't magically translate into good user experience.
							However, beautiful design conveys many values, as TRUST. Users will often trust a beautiful design over a flawed one. 
							We will come back to this later.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>UX is UI</h2>
						<h3>UX involves many other things</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Visual design</li>
							<li class="fragment">Interaction design</li>
							<li class="fragment">User testing</li>
							<li class="fragment">Performance</li>
							<li class="fragment">etc.</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							UX is more than just UI design. UX is about developing your user's experience, and that alone requires involvement from a lot of different areas.

						<h3>UX vs. UI: a few samples</h3>

						<h2>"Drop an asset library<br>and BAM!: UX"</h2>
						<img style="max-width: 40%" src="img/ui-kit-1.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							UX design is a process, it has to be deeply embedded into the development process,
							as it is iterative.<br>
							Open UI libs may solve a problem or two, but UX is different in every product,
							so it will always be developed for that product only.

						<h2>The infamous<br>"Design is art" myth</h2>
						<blockquote class="prettyBig prettyPadded" cite="http://searchservervirtualization.techtarget.com/definition/Our-Favorite-Technology-Quotations">
						"<strong>open source design</strong> is an oxymoron."<br>
						-Chris Messina
						</blockquote>
						<aside class="notes">
							Whoa! Another title.
							This is a very unfortunate and misleading quote.
							Some say design is art so it can't be done by collaborating, but design
							is not merely art. Art is totally unpaired with function, maybe we can
							discuss what's the "function" of art, but that's another topic.
							Let's see an industrial design example.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Design is form + function</h3>
						<img src="img/iron.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Style is unique to every designer, but design problems
							are constrained by the needs of function.
							Design comes from architecture (mostly), so does industrial design.
							Take this Siemens iron for example, it serves a purpose, so
							it basically looks like any iron, the color choice and ornamental
							details may vary from one to another, but the general function
							is dominant.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Flawed design</h3>
						<img src="img/bad-design.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							When design fails to serve its purpose, this happens.
							So this is not design, instead, it's a pretty strong art piece.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>Style varies</h3>
						<h4>It's a <span class="fragment highlight-blue">visual design</span> problem, not a UX one</h4>
						<img src="img/design-styles.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Style varies from one designer to another. This can lead to
							consistency issues, but it can be definitely solved by 
							agreeing on style conventions which are deeply intertwined with
							identity choices.

						<h2>"Free Software UX sucks"</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							This is a generalisation that really hurts the FOSS community.
							Let's try to find out why this happens.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Problems in FOSS UX</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>1. Lack of participation</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							There is an obvious lack of involvement of designers into 
							free software projects.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>2. No clear paths <br>for contribution</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Often, when you go to a project wiki, docs, issue trackers, community
							forums or whatever, it is hard to find which UX problems are there
							and how to solve them. 
							You'll find more "UI errors" than "UX problems". 
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>3. Devs don't know where to start</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Guys who are actually coding the UI don't know about the UX design process
							and they don't know where to start.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>4. Disconnected lone rangers</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							UI coders who don't work together produce both inconsistent code and UIs.
							Not having "UI teams" working towards consistency creates random pieces
							of UI goodness distributed in isolated pieces through a product.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>5. Style differences</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							When you actually have designers contributing, there will be style differences
							between them. As an artist, each designer has a unique style. These need to be sorted
							through a higher convention.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>6. "Can I Haz" requests</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Many times designers come with ideas that are unrealistic
							and difficult to implement, like whole new features. 
							These won't help as much as doing little improvements.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>7. Everyone is a designer</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Open source is about collaboration, but sometimes this leads
							to hundreds of people trying to be involved in design choices.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>8. Customize all the things</h2>
						<img src="img/customize-everything.jpg" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Free software makers often try to make software as customizable as possible.
							This is deeply linked to the heart and nature of open source, but it's really
							difficult to do well, and it leads to a lack of identity on many products.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>9. No proper tools</h2>
						<aside class="notes">
							Most tools of the trade for UX designers are closed and paid.
							We definitely need to find the right tools for design collaboration, 
							design voting, UX prototyping, etc.

						<h2>A roadmap for Contributing UX</h2>
						<h4>Challenges and opportunities</h4>
						<img class="noStyle" src="img/git-design-polish.jpg">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Community!</h2>
						<h4>Biggest perk from FOSS projects</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Always ask the community</li>
							<li>Get validation</li>
							<li>Be honest</li>
							<li>Invite others to join your quest</li>
							<li>Give recognition</li>
							<li>Don't take over</li>
							<li>Relax your ego</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="img/communities.jpg" height="300" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							Community is the biggest perk we have from FOSS projects.
							This is what most commercial projects don't have. 
							It has it's pros and cons, but overall, we can leverage the community
							to build the basics of User Experience for a product, and to do many other
							tasks, specially, the most important one: user testing.
							First, you'll have to get validation from the community. Contributing a patch
							could be a great start, but also, showing your will and your expertise could help.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Start with identity</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Analyze current status (colors, fonts, etc)</li>
							<li>Gather community opinions (survey)</li>
							<li>Begin with a proposal</li>
							<li>Explain why brand matters</li>
							<li>Beware of sensitive stuff (i.e.: LOGO)</li>
						</ul>
						<img src="img/identity.jpg" height="300" alt="">
						<aside class="notes">
							What's the status of identity on an X project?
							Identity will give you the basis for color choices, fonts,
							and it's also the first part of User Experience.
							By gathering the current status of identity and asking the 
							community
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Identify current UX problems</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Ask people, they know</li>
							<li>How about some user testing?</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Some UX problems may already be known in the community.
							Always ask the community first before asserting an assumption.
							Remember, assumptions are not good for UX. Data is.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Get UX into the integration loop</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Make UX a phase of development</li>
							<li>Get developers in the loop</li>
							<li>Test everything</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							UX should be deeply integrated into the software
							development process, as in a continuous integration scheme.
							Do user testing for UI changes.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Prototype and discuss</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>A/B testing (if possible)</li>
							<li>Test prototypes</li>
							<li>Give UI coders a finished prototype</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Once you get the prototype right, the widgets in place
							and the interactions in a well written spec, the task
							for developers is really easy. 
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Baby steps, small changes</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Don't go for the full redesign</li>
							<li>Propose small fixes</li>
							<li>Minimize coding effort</li>
							<li>Identify as many small problems as possible</li>
							<li>If possible, code something and show it</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							What can be fixed through only CSS?
							What can be done with just a line of code?
							There are many UX situations that can be drastically
							improved by just a few fixes. If you have the skills, you 
							can even show how a minor change would impact the UX in a
							browser window.
						</aside>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h2>Build a team</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>There is people working on UI</li>
							<li>Ask for participation</li>
							<li>Identify potential "UX guys"</li>
							<li>Get coders, translators, users, testers</li>
							<li>Create conventions and standards for consistency</li>
						</ul>
						<aside class="notes">
							Doing UX solo is not an easy task. You'll need tons
							of help from others.
							There is always people fond of UX and UI amongst coders. 
							Some coders hate talking about UIs, but some actually love it.
							You can also recruit other kinds of people with different skills, 
							to conduct a user testing session, to make prototypes, to translate 
							things, etc.

						<h2>Set goals and deadlines</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Deadlines are the ultimate fast decision makers</li>
							<li>Use UX metrics to set goals</li>

							No roadmap is a roadmap without goals and deadlines.
							Define sprints and use deadlines and milestones to 
							give others feedback of what your progress is.

						<h2>Show the larger picture</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Build a longer roadmap</li>
							<li>Get approval from the community</li>
							<li>Be realistic</li>
							<li>Review constantly</li>
							<li>If needed, reformulate</li>

							A mid-term roadmap will build trust around your work and 
							get everybody's expectations on the same page.

						<h2>Avoid the "taste police"</h2>
						<h4>Non-constructive criticism</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>"It feels weird..."</li>
							<li>"I hate pink..."</li>
							<li>"I don't like the font"</li>

							Beware of those really subjective things and justify your choices
							with reasoning, knowledge and of course, links to sources.

						<h2>Use open formats</h2>
						<ul>
							<li>Educate designers on open tools (Inkscape, GIMP, etc)</li>
							<li>Make assets freely available</li>

						<aside class="notes">
							As a free software advocate, I really encourage everyone to use
